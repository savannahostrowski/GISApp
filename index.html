            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Welcome! This is a web app designed as the final project for
              GEOG 481 - Geographic Information Systems Project at the University
              of Waterloo.</p>
            <h3>Who?</h3>
            <p> The analysis for the project was completed by Tasha-Leigh Gauthier, Luke Johnson, Savannah
              Ostrowski and Dana Thompson. This web app was designed and built by <a href="http://www.savannahostrowski.com">yours truly!</a></p>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>A web app about quantifying the effects of post-secondary students
              on sustainable development using a temporal analysis of Waterloo Region,
              Ontario, Canada.</p>
            <h3>When?</h3>
            <p>Sustainable development was considered over 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 census years but this study was conducted
              in Spring 2015.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>Waterloo is growing! It also has a bunch of universities and colleges! It's important
              to consider what types of initiatives will be needed in the future to continue
              growing!</p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p> Using both spatial and non-spatial data, the analysis considers the
              three pillars of sustainable development - environment, economy and society. Data
              sources include the Canadian census, and the Municipality of Waterloo.</p>

          <h2>A Short Summary of Our Findings</h2>
          <p>We found that students have been opting to live near university and college campuses! Their impact over time as been becoming more centralized
          around the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University campuses. However, their impact has also been becoming more and more expansive! Areas of low impact are moving outward towards more rural and less populous parts of the region.
          <br> 
          However, student population growth in the region has been forecasted to stagnate in the future by both city planners and economists. As a result, this study proves to be relevant to stakeholders but requires more information about environmental impact to gain more comprehensive insight!</p>
